-----------------------
Frensh, le french shell
-----------------------

Frensh aims at replacing all the existing shells, such as bash, zsh, ksh, fish, etc.
Just use it, and you'll see why :)

To set frensh as your default shell, enter this command:

::
    $ sudo usermod -s path/to/frensh USER

Note that if you really feel the need to go back to a lesser shell, type in the ``putain`` command, which will open a ``sh`` session.

Note
----
Please, use ``frensh`` on all your production servers. We have several cliens curently migrating. We're still waiting for confirmation from Google, Amazon and Red Hat.

Long live the french.
